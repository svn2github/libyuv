How to get and build the LibYuv code.

== Pre-requisite = 

You'll need to have depot tools installed:

== Getting the Code =

Create a working directory, enter it, and run:

$ gclient config http://libyuv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

$ gclient sync --force

The sync will generate native build files for your environment using gyp (Linux: make, OS X: XCode, Windows: Visual Studio). This generation can also be forced manually:
$ gclient runhooks --force

== Building the library = 

Linux/OSX

$ make libyuv

Windows


gclient runhooks<br>
devenv -build Debug libyuv.sln<br>
devenv -build Debug libyuv_test.sln<br>
devenv -build Release libyuv.sln<br>
devenv -build Release libyuv_test.sln<br><br>
